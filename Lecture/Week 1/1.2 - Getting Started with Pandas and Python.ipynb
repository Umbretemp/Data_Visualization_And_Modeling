    "# Pandas\n",
    "In the last lesson, we got to see Pandas in action by using it to make some visualizations of the data science salaries data.  Let's take some time to explore some of the cool features of Python and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The History of Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Origins:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2008: The Pandas project was started by Wes McKinney when he was working at AQR Capital Management. The main motivation was to have a flexible tool to perform quantitative analysis on financial data. The name \"pandas\" is derived from the term \"panel data,\" a common term for data that involves observations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2009: Wes McKinney released the first public version of pandas. The initial versions laid the foundation with data structures like Series and DataFrame, which have since become staples for data manipulation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing Adoption:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2010s: As data science and Python grew in popularity during the 2010s, so did pandas. It quickly became one of the cornerstones of the scientific stack in Python alongside libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "The library received significant contributions from many developers worldwide, enhancing its capabilities and making it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Books and Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2012: Wes McKinney published \"Python for Data Analysis,\" which prominently features pandas and its application in data analysis. This book played a crucial role in introducing many individuals to pandas and data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is often seen as a gateway to data science in Python. Its simple yet powerful interface makes it a favorite for beginners and professionals alike.\n",
    "With the rise of big data tools like Apache Spark, Dask, and Vaex, pandas also integrates with these tools, allowing users to scale their analyses when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DataFrames and Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame is the primary structure we will be using for this class.  It is an associative, two dimensional data structure. Imagine a spreadsheet page,  SQL table, or flat file.  The series object is a one dimensional data structure that represents a single column of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can manually create a DataFrame from dictionaries, lists, series, and much else.  We can also add new features to a DataFrame, or even combine multiple DataFrames.  If our data is provided to us we can read or write to a variety of different formats: CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, URL, clipboard, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A series object can be thought of as single column of a DataFrame."
