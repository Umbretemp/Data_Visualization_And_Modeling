    "Origins:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1980s: Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.\n",
    "* 1991: The first official version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. This version already included many features familiar to today's Python programmers, including exception handling, functions, and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The name \"Python\" was not derived from the snake, but rather as a tribute to the British comedy group \"Monty Python,\" whose work Guido van Rossum enjoyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1994: Python 1.0 was officially released, marking a significant milestone for the language. It included important features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "* 2000: Python 2.0 was released, introducing list comprehensions and garbage collection. One of the most significant additions in the Python 2 series was the introduction of the \"new-style classes\" in Python 2.2.\n",
    "* 2008: Python 3.0 (often called \"Python 3000\" or \"Py3k\") was released. It was designed to rectify fundamental flaws of the language. This version was not backward compatible with Python 2, which was a significant and somewhat controversial decision. Key changes included the print statement becoming a function (print()), integer division producing a float instead of an integer, and the introduction of the bytes type for handling binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy of Python 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even after the release of Python 3, Python 2 continued to be widely used. However, to move the community forward, the PSF announced that support for Python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) would end in 2020.\n",
    "* After January 1, 2020, Python 2 received no updates, even for security issues."

    "## Six Principles of Good Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clarity:\n",
    "* Avoid unnecessary clutter: Every element should have a purpose. Remove redundant or unnecessary information.\n",
    "* Choose the right visualization type: The type of visualization should align with what you're trying to convey. For instance, use bar charts for categorical data, line charts for time series, scatter plots for relationships, etc."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "2. Consistency:\n",
    "* Keep scales consistent: When comparing multiple plots, keep the scales consistent to avoid misinterpretation.\n",
    "* Use consistent colors and styles: If blue represents a particular category in one plot, it should represent the same in other plots."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "3. Simplicity:\n",
    "* Avoid too many colors: Using too many colors can be confusing. Stick to a small, consistent palette.\n",
    "* Limit the use of pie charts: Pie charts can be hard to interpret, especially with many slices. Consider bar charts or stacked bar charts as alternatives."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "4. Accessibility:\n",
    "* Color contrast: Ensure there's enough contrast between text and background and between different data elements. This is especially crucial for viewers with color vision deficiencies.\n",
    "* Avoid relying solely on color: For those with colorblindness, using patterns, annotations, or different line styles can help distinguish data.\n",
    "* Use larger text sizes: This ensures readability, especially for those with vision impairments.\n",
    "* Provide text descriptions: For complex visualizations or when publishing on the web, provide textual descriptions or summaries.\n",

    "5. Labeling & Annotation:\n",
    "* Descriptive titles: The title should summarize what the graph shows.\n",
    "* Label axes: Always label your axes, and if needed, provide units.\n",
    "* Annotations: Use them to highlight or explain specific points on your graph."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "6. Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
